# PRISM-placenta
Interactive Segmentation Model for Placenta Segmentation from 3D Ultrasound Images


## News
[07/07/24] Repo is created.

## TL;DR
PRISM is an **effective** and **efficient** 3D interactive model for placenta segmentation. 

## Effective 
Qualitative results with compared methods ![qualitative_results](figs/qualitative.png)

The quantitative results can be viewed in our [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15028).

## Efficient
We consider a Dice score of 0.95 as a bar for success, which is higher than inter-rater variability (0.85-0.90)
